    <h1>Index</h1>
    <h3>Foreword</h3>
    <p>This is my 2nd/3rd time coding a website. I use w3schools and codeavengers to help myself code and improve on my website.</p>
    <h3>The Beginning</h3>
    <p>I coded my website using a program called Brackets and I coded the CSS within the html file as well.</p>
    <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
    <img src="Palette.png">
    <p>I used these colors because I thought they fit the theme of a cafe.</p>
    <h3>Grid Template</h3>
    <img src="Grid-Template.png">
    <h3>Div Tags</h3>
    <p>I used a main div for my website's header, which is the title.</p>
    <h3>Validation</h3>
    <p>I used W3C's HTML and CSS validator for my website to check if anything was wrong with it.</p>
    <h3>Logo</h3>
    <p>I created my own logo using a coffee bean image and adding words to it. I used brown for the coffee bean and I used yellow to make the words stand out and to match the school's logo color.</p>
    <h3>Lists</h3>
    <p>I used the list coding for the navbars.</p>
    <h3>Borders</h3>
    <p>I edited my borders using CSS.</p>
